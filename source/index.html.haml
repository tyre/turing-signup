    Becoming a developer takes the right mix of passion, curiosity, creativity, and confidence. We’ve found that combination across a variety of backgrounds including financial analysts, warehouse managers, bartenders, musicians and electrical engineers. If you show the right aptitude and are ready to work hard, we’ll turn you into a professional software developer.

        Being a good developer does not prepare you to teach development. The Turing staff blends programming experience with years of classroom instruction. No other team can match our depth of expertise and on-the-ground instructional experience.

      “I chose this program because was the only one that promised to produce professional developers and not just give you a kickstart. I had no computer science background and needed to have a real job at the end of it. <br/><br/>We learned by doing – by working together to build real applications, completely immersed in programming. Now I use those skills every day.“

    %h2 The Program
    %p
      What can you accomplish in seven months? Our students build the skills they need to develop professional web applications: test-driven development, object-oriented design, and how to decompose complex problems. As programmers they become proficient with Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, source control, REST, and providing, consuming, and testing APIs. As developers they learn to work in small teams, communicate, and collaborate effectively.
